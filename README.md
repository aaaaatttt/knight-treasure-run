A 2D platformer game built with **Godot 4**, where you play as a brave knight collecting treasures, avoiding enemies, and reaching the final goal flag to win!

##  Game Overview
**Knight's Treasure Run** is a simple yet fun arcade platformer.  
Players control a knight to jump across platforms, collect coins, and dodge moving enemies.  
Once all treasures are collected, a **goal flag** appears — touch it to complete the level.  

But beware! Falling off the map or touching an enemy sends you to the game-over screen.
